/**
 * A new feature has been added - the ability to add anime to tabs like `viewed`, `favorites`, etc.
 * The reason for this is that the application should have a separate tab to view all anime
 * by certain parameters such as `dropped`. To display information for each anime,
 * multiple requests to the JikanAPI would be required.
 * <p>
 * However, the JikanAPI server only allows for three requests per second. To mitigate this issue,
 * a new entity has been created in the database to store minimal information about each anime
 * (id and title) that has been added to tabs like `viewed`, etc.
 * <p>
 * The list of favorite anime will be retrieved from the database, but additional details will be
 * obtained from the JikanAPI based on user requests. The database will only store the id and name of
 * the anime and will not store any extra information.
